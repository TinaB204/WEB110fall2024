                <h2><a href="#final4.html">Python*</a></h2>
                <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted language with the primary principle of ease of readability. It caters to a number of programming paradigms: procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Its large extent of the standard library and vigorous community turn Python into an applicable choice for a whole variety of aspects—from web development to data science</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">Java*</a></h2>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented, class-based language with as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is known for its system independence, because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Nowadays, it is heavily applied everywhere in enterprise environments and in the development of Android apps and large-scale systems.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">SQL*</a></h2>
                <p>SQL is the language standard of relational database management and manipulation. It is, hence, a quite important tool in querying and managing databases applied to various aspects.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">JavaScript*</a></h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level language, mostly applied in web development. It gives the competing power of dynamic content on websites and is supported by all modern web browsers. Then, with Node.js, JavaScript started to be in wide usage for server-side development; therefore, it became one of the most critical languages in full-stack development.</p>  
                <h2><a href="final4.html">C#*</a></h2>
                <p>C# is a modern, high-level object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It represents an element of the .NET ecosystem and literally means being simple, robust, and in a position to empower a developer for creating any form of application, whether on the desktop, the web, or even in a mobile environment.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">C++*</a></h2>
                <p>C++ is certainly a rather powerful extension of standard C, which adds to it the power of object-oriented features. It also boasts features such as high performance and efficiency, making it quite fit for system programming, game development, and even applications that need real-time processing.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">Ruby*</a></h2>
                <p>Ruby is an open-sourced, dynamic language designed with ease of use and productivity in mind. It has a very clean syntax that’s easy to read and write.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">PHP*</a></h2>
                <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language for development on the Internet, though it has also been used as a general programming language. It finds its major applications in the creation of dynamic websites and Content Management Systems (CMS).</p>  
                <h2><a href="final4.html">Typescript*</a></h2>
                <p>TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static types to the language, which can improve code quality and maintainability.</p>
                <h2><a href="final4.html">HTML*</a></h2>
                <p>HTML is a specialized language for describing the appearance and content of web pages, often extended using CSS and SCSSS.</p>
