                <h2>Hello And Welcome!</h2>
                <p>This site is dedicated to my current interests and hobbies of textile handicrafts and computer programming.  Computers are my future profession and handicrafts will always be how I can feel creative and at peace.</p>
                <p>Both interests are practical skills that are able to meet needs by creative and logical thinking that often uses repetition and patterns.  Also, they can be either artistic or utilitarian depending on mood or situation. These qualities are what I enjoy most about them.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Fort Osage High School where I was part of the Honor Society, French Club, the musical Oklahoma and the Indianette drill team. I went on to complete 5 sememsters of college before being an au pair in the Netherlands.  From the Netherlands, I return to the U.S. to marry my active duty fianc&eacute;.  We were married 27 years and had 6 children that I stayed home with to raise and to homeschool.</p>
                <p>I still homeschool my younger 3 children while I am going to college to complete a degree that I started way before them.  At this point in my life, I am really enjoying what I'm learning and I am happy to have discovered my next profession.</p>
